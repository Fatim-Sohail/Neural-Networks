Hello and welcome to my neural networks repository on GitHub!

This repository contains implementations of neural networks using popular framework; PyTorch. The code is organized into subdirectories based on the type of neural network architecture. 

In each subdirectory, you will find Python scripts that demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate neural networks using the corresponding architecture. The scripts include comments that explain each step in detail. 

I hope you find this repository helpful in learning about neural networks and their applications. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to create an issue or reach out to me directly. Thank you for visiting!
